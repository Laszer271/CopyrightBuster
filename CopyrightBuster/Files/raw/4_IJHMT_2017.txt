The paper shows the results for flow boiling heat transfer in a 1.7 mm deep minichannel vertically ori-
ented with FC-72 Fluorinert as a working fluid. The heated wall of the minichannel was formed with a
thin foil. Thermocouples mounted at 18 points monitored the outer foil surface temperature. All exper-
imental parameters were controlled using data acquisition stations. The measurements were performed
at 0.01 s intervals. The observations of the flow structures were carried out concurrently on the internal
surface of the foil contacting the fluid. The aim of the numerical calculations was to determine the heat
transfer coefficient on the contact surface between the heated foil and FC-72. The heat transfer coefficient
was calculated with the use of the Robin boundary condition. To do that, the foil and fluid temperatures
and foil temperature gradient had to be known. The foil temperature was found by solving an unsteady-
state two-dimensional inverse boundary problem with the use of the Trefftz method in time-space sub-
domains. A linear combination of Trefftz functions was used to approximate the foil temperature. The
unknown coefficients of the Trefftz function linear combination were determined by minimizing the
functional. Error propagation in time and mean relative differences determined between the measured
and computed heated foil temperatures were presented.

1. Introduction
Minimizing the size of heat exchangers while maximizing their
thermal efficiency, lifespan, run time and cost is a challenge for the
designers of modern devices. One of the efficient cooling methods
is the use of phase change heat transfer processes, such as flow
boiling which has gained growing interest in thermal science for
providing very high heat transfer coefficients compared to those
from single phase convection. However, flow boiling heat transfer
is characterized by unstable flow phenomena and various heat
transfer regimes, which being dependent on heat flux, mass flow
rate, pressure, channel wall roughness and properties of the work-
ing fluid, add to the complexity of the process.
Numerous research studies have been devoted to calculating
flow boiling heat transfer in mini spaces but the results of these
calculations need to be compared to experimental data. Experi-
ment is critical especially in complicated heat transfer systems,
with bubbles larger than the channel size, where predictions con-
cerning heat transfer are limited. A brief review of similar issues
reported by other researchers is presented below. Experiments
concerning time-dependent flow parameters were conducted by
[1­7]. The enhancement of heat transfer due to the Taylor bubble
train flow presented in comparison with thermally developing
single-phase flows was studied by [1]. The experiments presented
in [2] were carried out to evaluate the transient heat transfer char-
acteristics of a minichannel heat sink under high heat flux density.
A method for the measurement of transient fluid temperature in
high-pressure systems was developed by the authors of [3]. In
[4], the dynamics of pressure and temperature fluctuations occur-
ring in flow boiling in a minichannel was investigated. In [5], the
author presented a mathematical model of a transient heat transfer
process for non-contacting face seals described by the fractional
heat conduction equation. In [6], unsteady-state flow boiling in a
rectangular minichannel was described, with a flow stability crite-
rion depending on two controlled parameters: heat flux and mass-
flow rate. The authors of [7] reported periodic flow boiling investi-
gations, including oscillations of channel wall temperature, local
heat transfer coefficients and inlet and outlet pressure. A full anal-
ysis of the temperature measurements and pressure data obtained
during the growth of a vapour bubble in the microchannel was
provided.
Identification of a heat transfer coefficient is one of inverse heat
conduction problems [8­10]. The method proposed in 1926 by
Trefftz [11] has been found to be especially suitable for solving

inverse problems. It employs a linear combination of functions that
satisfy differential equations identically, Trefftz functions, for
approximating the unknown solution of the differential equations.
All you have to do is to adjust the approximate value to the bound-
ary conditions and, in nonstationary problems, also to the initial
conditions. Details about the Trefftz method can be found in [12­
15]. The Trefftz functions-based method can be used to solve both
stationary [16,17] and nonstationary problems [18­22] and for
constructing base functions in FEM [23­29]. Spatial-temporal base
functions are presented in [23,26].
Experimental data were the basis for the analysis of steady-
state flow boiling heat transfer in minichannels performed by the
authors of this paper in their previous works [28,30­34]. Currently,
their research interest is focused on unsteady-state flow boiling
heat transfer in rectangular minichannels.
2. The experimental database
2.1. Experimental stand
The essential part of the experimental stand - the testing mod-
ule with a minichannel, flow loop and data and image acquisition
system, are presented in Fig. 1. The test module is composed of
two 16 mm wide and 180 mm long minichannels (1). The PTFE
spacer (3) is used to achieve a specific dimension of the minichan-
nel depth (1.7 mm). A thin foil (4) provides the heated wall for FC-
72 Fluorinert flowing in the minichannels. The foil, made of
Haynes-230 alloy, has a guaranteed precision thickness of approx-
imately 0.1 mm. In the main minichannel, the foil temperature is
measured with K-type thermocouples (T1
­T18
). Two additional
thermocouples (T19
, T20
) were installed at the inlet and outlet of
the minichannels. This contact temperature measurement method
is used to obtain the basic data of the heated minichannel wall for
calculations in one minichannel while in the other minichannel foil
temperature is monitored by an infrared camera (8). Infrared
thermography as a contactless temperature measurement method
is used for the comparison of temperature measurements from
thermocouples, at selected time intervals. The other side of the
heated foil is observed through a glass pane (2) to visualize the
two-phase flow patterns in minichannels using high-speed camera
(9) and the lighting system. The data acquisition system is made up
of two data acquisition stations (11, 12), a computer (13) and
appropriate software. A mass flow meter (18) is used to control
the fluid flow in the flow loop. Fluid inlet and outlet pressure are
also measured due to pressure converters. The supply and control
system contains an inverter welder, a shunt, an ammeter and a
voltmeter.
2.2. Experimental methodology and uncertainties
Each experimental series with the laminar flow of FC-72 in
minichannels lasted approximately two minutes. The temperature
of the foil surface was monitored continuously at 18 points by K-
type thermocouples placed at the outer surface along the central,
axially symmetric axis of the main minichannel. The signals from
the thermocouples controlling foil temperature at the selected
points (marked as T1
. . . T18
in Fig. 1a) and the two thermocouples
installed at the inlet and outlet of the minichannels (marked as T19
and T20
) were recorded using a DaqLab 2005 data acquisition sta-
tion (11). Simultaneously, two-phase flow structures in the
minichannel were observed using a JAI Coaxpress high-speed cam-
era (9) and foil temperature was monitored by a FLIR E60 infrared
camera (8). The pressure of the fluid at the minichannel inlet (pin
)
and outlet (pout
), the current supplied to the foil (I), the voltage
drop across the foil (DU) and mass flow were also recorded using
an MCC SC-1608G data acquisition device with analog signal con-
ditioning (12). The measurements were carried out with a fre-
quency of 0.01 s. All parameters recorded during the experiment
and the apparatus used for measurements (with accuracy) are
listed in Table 1.
3. Determining heat transfer coefficient
Two-dimensional nonstationary heat flow was assumed. The
temperature variation along the minichannel width was not taken
into account. Two dimensions were accounted for: dimension x
along the flow direction and dimension y perpendicular to the flow
direction, related to the thickness of the heated foil.
The Robin boundary condition was used to calculate the local
values of the heat transfer coefficient:

4. Results
During the experimental series (123 s), the current supplied to
the heated foil is progressively increased, thus increasing the heat
flux transferred to the boiling fluid flowing in the minichannels. To
be able to use the experimental data in our calculations, we
decided to limit the amount of data to those obtained in the period
from the beginning of the experiment up to 22 s (for analyzing the
results obtained for the subcooled boiling region) and between 88 s
and 123 s (for analyzing the results obtained for the saturated boil-
ing region). The data for the time from 22.01 to 87.99 s, outside of
these two regions and corresponding to transient boiling, were not
shown and discussed in this paper. At the beginning of the exper-
iment, the liquid inlet mass flow rate was fixed.
Figs. 3 and 4 show the local values of foil temperature and the
heat transfer coefficient vs. time at the boundary y = d with the
heat flux being increased during the experimental series. Experi-
mental data are presented in Figs. 5­8.
The foil temperature and local values of the heat transfer coef-
ficient were obtained by solving the inverse heat conduction prob-
lem with the Trefftz method in the time-space subdomains. The
calculations were performed using the time-dependent tempera-
ture measurements. The study involved the identification of this
coefficient in two boiling regions: the subcooled boiling region
and the saturated boiling region.
The time step of 1 s was assumed in computation; the space
area in each time step was divided into 4 sub-areas. With the divi-
sion into space-time sub-areas, the fit of the approximate solution
at boundary y = 0 to temperature measurements was investigated.

Results are listed for the subcooled boiling region and the satu-
rated boiling region in Fig. 9a and b, separately.
Analysis of the results indicates that at time steps/moments
above 18 s, the approximate solution at boundary y = 0 shows bet-
ter fit to the measured surface temperatures than at the initial time
steps/moment (mean relative differences reach about 2.5% at up to
18 s and show noticeably lower values, about 1.5%, in the subse-
quent time interval of 18­22 s).
In the saturated boiling region, the mean relative differences are
about 2% between 88 s and 110 s. In further time steps, the differ-
ences increase considerably reaching the highest levels (10%) in the
final phase of saturated boiling, approaching the dryout.
In Fig. 3a and b the values of the foil temperature were pre-
sented at four selected points along the channel corresponding to
four thermocouples Nos. 4, 8, 12, 16 (T4
, T8
, T12
and T16
, see deno-
tations in Fig. 1). It can be noticed that in the subcooled boiling
region, an increase in the heat flux caused an increase in the
928 B. Maciejewska, M. Piasecka / International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer 107 (2017) 925­933
temperature of the heated foil (Fig. 3a), with no `nucleation hys-
teresis'. In the saturated boiling region, an increase in the temper-
ature of the heated foil vs. time is observed for the thermocouples
nos. 4, 8 and 12. Since the results obtained at the point correspond-
ing to thermocouple no. 16 had different plots from the others
(much higher values, with clear local minimum for time = 114 s),
they were compiled with those obtained for the two neighboring
points corresponding to thermocouples no. 15 and no. 17. The sub-
stantial foil temperature increase at three points located at the
minichannel outlet (thermocouples no. 15, no. 16 and no. 17)
was probably caused by nearly complete evaporation of the liquid
phase (dryout) from the mixture flowing in the minichannel. Foil
temperature changes in time interval from 112 s to 114 s near
outlet of the minichannel could result from dynamic changes in
the two-phase flow patterns which in this developed saturated
boiling region look like moving layers of ``vapour cork". Such struc-
ture was observed in experiments with the vertical position of the
minichannel and upflow when the boundary between liquid and
vapour is hardly recognizable and sometimes it is not possible to
differentiate liquid droplets in the vapour mist [30]. At high heat
flux forming cork structures may result in local wall temperature
drop, not only its increase. Further increase in heat flux during
experiment will provide to critical heat flux and appearance of
the boiling crisis resulting in overheating of the heated surface
and decreasing the efficiency of heat transfer.

The values of the time-dependent heat transfer coefficient and
the boundary y = d, in the subcooled boiling region are shown in
Fig. 4a and in Fig. 4b and c for the saturated boiling region. There
was a uniform monotonic increase in the heat transfer coefficient
over time in the subcooled boiling region, which confirms the
results obtained by the authors in their earlier studies when
steady-state conditions were analyzed [30,32]. In this boiling
region, an increase in the heat flux increased the value of heat
transfer coefficient. In the saturated boiling region, the lowest coef-
ficients were observed at the minichannel outlet and at the final
stage of the experiment for the highest heat fluxes supplied to
the heated foil, similarly as reported in [30,32­34]. The highest
coefficients were obtained at the beginning of the time interval
under analysis, indicating the beginning of the saturated boiling
in the minichannel. Thermocouple no. 4 was mounted near the
minichannel inlet so the highest values of the local heat transfer
coefficient were observed in this place at the saturated boiling
region (see Fig. 4b). The position of other thermocouples corre-
sponding to values of the local heat transfer coefficient were get-
ting lower and the lowest values of the coefficient are reported
at the channel outlet (at the location of the thermocouple no.
16). The results shown in Fig. 4b also indicate discrepancies in
the coefficient relations identified as a function of time in the sat-
urated boiling region, given at points corresponding to thermocou-
ple no. 4, probably related to saturated boiling variations during
the registration of flow oscillations (see Fig. 5), pressure fluctua-
tions (see Fig. 6) and dynamic changes in the two-phase flow pat-
terns. Since the local heat transfer coefficients corresponding to the
temperatures indicated by thermocouple no. 4 had different plots
from the others (much higher values, with a few extremes), in
Fig. 4c they were compiled local heat transfer coefficients corre-
sponding to the indication of two neighboring thermocouples no.
3 and no. 5. All three plots of heat transfer coefficient vs. time in
Fig. 4c appeared to be similar, which confirms the higher values
of the coefficient and occurrence of its extremes for approximated
times t = 100 s (minimum) and t = 112 s (maximum). The temper-
ature relationships shown in Fig. 3c, which indicate a dryout, are
supported by the distribution of local heat transfer coefficients,
as for thermocouple no. 16 the coefficient values were lowest
(see Fig. 4c). Generally, the results shown in Fig. 4 confirm the heat
transfer coefficient dependencies previously observed when the
authors analyzed results obtained from experiments and calcula-
tions conducted for the steady state.
The instability of mass flux and pressure are widely featured in
many works on the flow with change of phase. Papers often
reported instabilities under certain conditions in micro- or
minichannels as e.g. [4,6,35­39]. Some scientists assume that phe-
nomena during flow boiling have a wave-like nature, others repre-
sent the concepts of classification flow structures as repeated
cyclically, the so-called oscillating flow structures of different
types. According to [6] a stability criterion might be derived from
the experimental results considering the two controlled parame-
ters (heat flux and liquid inlet mass flow rate). In the experiment
the liquid inlet mass flow rate is kept nearly constant and heat flux
is gradually increased.
The values of the time-dependent experimental parameters for
the tested series are presented for: mass flow rate - in Fig. 5, inlet

subcooled boiling region, (b) the saturated boiling region; volumetric heat flux:
qV
= 288­374 MW/m3 (the subcooled boiling region), qV
= 642­781 MW/m3 (the
saturated boiling region); experimental parameters as shown in Figs. 6 and 7.

pressure - in Fig. 6 and outlet pressure - in Fig. 7. The values
obtained for the subcooled boiling region are shown in
Figs. 5a, 6a and 7a and for the saturated boiling region - in
Figs. 5b, 6b and 7b, respectively. Observed instabilities are
dynamic. Such instabilities are related to the change of the mass
flow density (density-wave instability) and often occur with
pressure-drop instabilities. Analysis of all instabilities recorded
during the experiment indicates their oscillating character. The
instabilities in mass flow rate recorded in the saturated boiling
region (Fig. 5b) have also a wavy character.
Dynamic instabilities are often accompanied by thermal oscilla-
tions which occur in a convective boiling upflow system. The term
``thermal oscillations" has been used in situations where tempera-
ture fluctuations occur in a solid interacting with a fluid. The ther-
mal oscillations are characterized by large amplitude fluctuations
in the heated wall temperature. The flow oscillates between differ-
ent types of two-phase flow and thus produces large amplitude
temperature oscillations [40,41]. Fig. 8 shows an example of the
thermal oscillations plot. The values of the time-dependent foil
temperature recorded for thermocouple No. 8 were selected as
representative values for each of boiling regions, i.e., for the sub-
cooled boiling region data and for the saturated boiling region, as
presented in Fig. 8a and c, respectively.

Fig. 10 presents the values of the time-dependent mean relative

arately for the subcooled boiling region, Fig. 10a, and the saturated
boiling region, Fig. 10b. In the subcooled boiling region, the values
of errors were about 5% for all measurements. The relationship in
Fig. 10a indicates that mean relative differences in this boiling
region decrease nearly linearly during the experiment. The present

results confirm the errors obtained previously in the steady
state measurements, whose values were also 2­6%.
In the saturated boiling region, the errors were noticeably
higher, from about 20% at the final moment of the experiment
(118­123 s) to even 58% at 108 s of the experiment. Fig. 10b shows
a large scatter of the errors between 88 and 114 s. In the steady
state experiments, the values of errors were also considerably
higher in the saturated boiling region, in the order of 20% [42], than
those obtained in the subcooled boiling region. These relatively
high error values are likely associated with a small difference
between the heated foil temperature and the saturation tempera-
ture (T(x, d, t) À Tsat
(x, t)) in Eq. (1), along with substantial fluctua-
tions and oscillations of the experimental parameters acquired in
the saturated boiling region.
6. Conclusions
Flow boiling heat transfer with FC-72 Fluorinert was evaluated
in a vertical minichannel with a thin foil as a heated element. The
temperature of the foil was observed by 18 K-type thermocouples
mounted at 18 points on its outer surface. Data acquisition stations
monitored all experimental parameters measured at 0.01 s inter-
vals. The heat transfer coefficient at the foil-fluid interface was cal-
culated. The solution to a two-dimensional unsteady-state inverse
boundary problem, solved in time-dependent subdomains using
the Trefftz method, gave the foil temperature. Its approximate
value satisfies the differential equation exactly. The boundary con-
ditions are satisfied only approximately. Time-dependent Trefftz
functions were found to be suitable for constructing approximate
solution to the heat equation needed to identify the time-
dependent heat transfer coefficient.
The temperature field distributions on foil-fluid contact surface
and the local heat transfer coefficient were analyzed separately for
two areas: the subcooled and the saturated boiling regions. It can
be noticed that in the subcooled boiling region, an increase in
the heat flux caused an increase in the temperature of the heated
foil with no nucleation hysteresis. In the saturated boiling region
a considerable foil temperature increase was observed at the
minichannel outlet, caused probably by the dryout.
The values of the time-dependent heat transfer coefficient and
at the boundary y = d, in the subcooled boiling, indicated a uniform
monotonic increase over time, which confirms the results obtained
by the authors in their previous studies of steady-state conditions.
In the subcooled boiling region, the heat transfer coefficient was
relatively low. The local values of the heat transfer coefficient
increased slightly with the distance from the minichannel inlet.
In the saturated boiling region the heat transfer coefficient was
very high. The highest coefficients in the time interval analyzed
corresponded to the beginning of saturated boiling in the
minichannel. The lowest values of the coefficient were observed
at the channel outlet. At the inlet, local heat transfer coefficients
show a noticeable scatter during the experiment. A uniform
decrease in the coefficient value over time was observed at consec-
utive points located along the minichannel.
Error propagation in time was investigated and low errors in the
subcooled boiling region and high errors in the saturated boiling
region were observed. The mean relative differences determined
between the measured and computed heated foil temperatures
did not exceed 10% in the entire experiment.
