abstract
The paper shows the results for flow boiling heat transfer in a 1.7 mm deep minichannel vertically oriented with FC-72 Fluorinert as a working fluid. The heated wall of the minichannel was formed with a thin foil. Thermocouples mounted at 18 points monitored the outer foil surface temperature. All experimental parameters were controlled using data acquisition stations. The measurements were performed at 0.01 s intervals. The observations of the flow structures were carried out concurrently on the internal surface of the foil contacting the fluid. The aim of the numerical calculations was to determine the heat transfer coefficient on the contact surface between the heated foil and FC-72. The heat transfer coefficient was calculated with the use of the Robin boundary condition. To do that, the foil and fluid temperatures and foil temperature gradient had to be known. The foil temperature was found by solving an unsteadystate two-dimensional inverse boundary problem with the use of the Trefftz method in time-space subdomains. A linear combination of Trefftz functions was used to approximate the foil temperature. The unknown coefficients of the Trefftz function linear combination were determined by minimizing the functional. Error propagation in time and mean relative differences determined between the measured and computed heated foil temperatures were presented.

1. Introduction
Minimizing the size of heat exchangers while maximizing their thermal efficiency, lifespan, run time and cost is a challenge for the designers of modern devices. One of the efficient cooling methods is the use of phase change heat transfer processes, such as flow boiling which has gained growing interest in thermal science for providing very high heat transfer coefficients compared to those from single phase convection. However, flow boiling heat transfer is characterized by unstable flow phenomena and various heat transfer regimes, which being dependent on heat flux, mass flow rate, pressure, channel wall roughness and properties of the working fluid, add to the complexity of the process.
Numerous research studies have been devoted to calculating flow boiling heat transfer in mini spaces but the results of these calculations need to be compared to experimental data. Experiment is critical especially in complicated heat transfer systems, with bubbles larger than the channel size, where predictions concerning heat transfer are limited. A brief review of similar issues reported by other researchers is presented below. Experiments

concerning time-dependent flow parameters were conducted by [1­7]. The enhancement of heat transfer due to the Taylor bubble train flow presented in comparison with thermally developing single-phase flows was studied by [1]. The experiments presented in [2] were carried out to evaluate the transient heat transfer characteristics of a minichannel heat sink under high heat flux density. A method for the measurement of transient fluid temperature in high-pressure systems was developed by the authors of [3]. In [4], the dynamics of pressure and temperature fluctuations occurring in flow boiling in a minichannel was investigated. In [5], the author presented a mathematical model of a transient heat transfer process for non-contacting face seals described by the fractional heat conduction equation. In [6], unsteady-state flow boiling in a rectangular minichannel was described, with a flow stability criterion depending on two controlled parameters: heat flux and massflow rate. The authors of [7] reported periodic flow boiling investigations, including oscillations of channel wall temperature, local heat transfer coefficients and inlet and outlet pressure. A full analysis of the temperature measurements and pressure data obtained during the growth of a vapour bubble in the microchannel was provided.
Identification of a heat transfer coefficient is one of inverse heat conduction problems [8­10]. The method proposed in 1926 by Trefftz [11] has been found to be especially suitable for solving

inverse problems. It employs a linear combination of functions that satisfy differential equations identically, Trefftz functions, for approximating the unknown solution of the differential equations. All you have to do is to adjust the approximate value to the boundary conditions and, in nonstationary problems, also to the initial conditions. Details about the Trefftz method can be found in [12­ 15]. The Trefftz functions-based method can be used to solve both stationary [16,17] and nonstationary problems [18­22] and for constructing base functions in FEM [23­29]. Spatial-temporal base functions are presented in [23,26].
Experimental data were the basis for the analysis of steadystate flow boiling heat transfer in minichannels performed by the authors of this paper in their previous works [28,30­34]. Currently, their research interest is focused on unsteady-state flow boiling heat transfer in rectangular minichannels.
2. The experimental database
2.1. Experimental stand
The essential part of the experimental stand - the testing module with a minichannel, flow loop and data and image acquisition system, are presented in Fig. 1. The test module is composed of two 16 mm wide and 180 mm long minichannels (1). The PTFE spacer (3) is used to achieve a specific dimension of the minichannel depth (1.7 mm). A thin foil (4) provides the heated wall for FC72 Fluorinert flowing in the minichannels. The foil, made of Haynes-230 alloy, has a guaranteed precision thickness of approximately 0.1 mm. In the main minichannel, the foil temperature is measured with K-type thermocouples (T1­T18). Two additional thermocouples (T19, T20) were installed at the inlet and outlet of the minichannels. This contact temperature measurement method is used to obtain the basic data of the heated minichannel wall for calculations in one minichannel while in the other minichannel foil temperature is monitored by an infrared camera (8). Infrared thermography as a contactless temperature measurement method is used for the comparison of temperature measurements from thermocouples, at selected time intervals. The other side of the heated foil is observed through a glass pane (2) to visualize the two-phase flow patterns in minichannels using high-speed camera

(9) and the lighting system. The data acquisition system is made up of two data acquisition stations (11, 12), a computer (13) and appropriate software. A mass flow meter (18) is used to control the fluid flow in the flow loop. Fluid inlet and outlet pressure are also measured due to pressure converters. The supply and control system contains an inverter welder, a shunt, an ammeter and a voltmeter.
2.2. Experimental methodology and uncertainties
Each experimental series with the laminar flow of FC-72 in minichannels lasted approximately two minutes. The temperature of the foil surface was monitored continuously at 18 points by Ktype thermocouples placed at the outer surface along the central, axially symmetric axis of the main minichannel. The signals from the thermocouples controlling foil temperature at the selected points (marked as T1 . . . T18 in Fig. 1a) and the two thermocouples installed at the inlet and outlet of the minichannels (marked as T19 and T20) were recorded using a DaqLab 2005 data acquisition station (11). Simultaneously, two-phase flow structures in the minichannel were observed using a JAI Coaxpress high-speed camera (9) and foil temperature was monitored by a FLIR E60 infrared camera (8). The pressure of the fluid at the minichannel inlet (pin) and outlet (pout), the current supplied to the foil (I), the voltage drop across the foil (DU) and mass flow were also recorded using an MCC SC-1608G data acquisition device with analog signal conditioning (12). The measurements were carried out with a frequency of 0.01 s. All parameters recorded during the experiment and the apparatus used for measurements (with accuracy) are listed in Table 1.
3. Determining heat transfer coefficient
Two-dimensional nonstationary heat flow was assumed. The temperature variation along the minichannel width was not taken into account. Two dimensions were accounted for: dimension x along the flow direction and dimension y perpendicular to the flow direction, related to the thickness of the heated foil.
The Robin boundary condition was used to calculate the local values of the heat transfer coefficient:

4. Results

During the experimental series (123 s), the current supplied to the heated foil is progressively increased, thus increasing the heat flux transferred to the boiling fluid flowing in the minichannels. To be able to use the experimental data in our calculations, we decided to limit the amount of data to those obtained in the period from the beginning of the experiment up to 22 s (for analyzing the results obtained for the subcooled boiling region) and between 88 s and 123 s (for analyzing the results obtained for the saturated boiling region). The data for the time from 22.01 to 87.99 s, outside of these two regions and corresponding to transient boiling, were not shown and discussed in this paper. At the beginning of the experiment, the liquid inlet mass flow rate was fixed.
Figs. 3 and 4 show the local values of foil temperature and the heat transfer coefficient vs. time at the boundary y = d with the heat flux being increased during the experimental series. Experimental data are presented in Figs. 5­8.
The foil temperature and local values of the heat transfer coefficient were obtained by solving the inverse heat conduction problem with the Trefftz method in the time-space subdomains. The calculations were performed using the time-dependent temperature measurements. The study involved the identification of this coefficient in two boiling regions: the subcooled boiling region and the saturated boiling region.
The time step of 1 s was assumed in computation; the space area in each time step was divided into 4 sub-areas. With the division into space-time sub-areas, the fit of the approximate solution at boundary y = 0 to temperature measurements was investigated.

Results are listed for the subcooled boiling region and the saturated boiling region in Fig. 9a and b, separately.
Analysis of the results indicates that at time steps/moments above 18 s, the approximate solution at boundary y = 0 shows better fit to the measured surface temperatures than at the initial time steps/moment (mean relative differences reach about 2.5% at up to 18 s and show noticeably lower values, about 1.5%, in the subsequent time interval of 18­22 s).
In the saturated boiling region, the mean relative differences are about 2% between 88 s and 110 s. In further time steps, the differences increase considerably reaching the highest levels (10%) in the final phase of saturated boiling, approaching the dryout.
In Fig. 3a and b the values of the foil temperature were presented at four selected points along the channel corresponding to four thermocouples Nos. 4, 8, 12, 16 (T4, T8, T12 and T16, see denotations in Fig. 1). It can be noticed that in the subcooled boiling region, an increase in the heat flux caused an increase in the

temperature of the heated foil (Fig. 3a), with no `nucleation hysteresis'. In the saturated boiling region, an increase in the temperature of the heated foil vs. time is observed for the thermocouples nos. 4, 8 and 12. Since the results obtained at the point corresponding to thermocouple no. 16 had different plots from the others (much higher values, with clear local minimum for time = 114 s), they were compiled with those obtained for the two neighboring points corresponding to thermocouples no. 15 and no. 17. The substantial foil temperature increase at three points located at the minichannel outlet (thermocouples no. 15, no. 16 and no. 17) was probably caused by nearly complete evaporation of the liquid phase (dryout) from the mixture flowing in the minichannel. Foil temperature changes in time interval from 112 s to 114 s near

outlet of the minichannel could result from dynamic changes in the two-phase flow patterns which in this developed saturated boiling region look like moving layers of ``vapour cork". Such structure was observed in experiments with the vertical position of the minichannel and upflow when the boundary between liquid and vapour is hardly recognizable and sometimes it is not possible to differentiate liquid droplets in the vapour mist [30]. At high heat flux forming cork structures may result in local wall temperature drop, not only its increase. Further increase in heat flux during experiment will provide to critical heat flux and appearance of the boiling crisis resulting in overheating of the heated surface and decreasing the efficiency of heat transfer.

The values of the time-dependent heat transfer coefficient and the boundary y = d, in the subcooled boiling region are shown in Fig. 4a and in Fig. 4b and c for the saturated boiling region. There was a uniform monotonic increase in the heat transfer coefficient over time in the subcooled boiling region, which confirms the results obtained by the authors in their earlier studies when steady-state conditions were analyzed [30,32]. In this boiling region, an increase in the heat flux increased the value of heat transfer coefficient. In the saturated boiling region, the lowest coefficients were observed at the minichannel outlet and at the final stage of the experiment for the highest heat fluxes supplied to the heated foil, similarly as reported in [30,32­34]. The highest coefficients were obtained at the beginning of the time interval under analysis, indicating the beginning of the saturated boiling in the minichannel. Thermocouple no. 4 was mounted near the minichannel inlet so the highest values of the local heat transfer coefficient were observed in this place at the saturated boiling region (see Fig. 4b). The position of other thermocouples corresponding to values of the local heat transfer coefficient were getting lower and the lowest values of the coefficient are reported at the channel outlet (at the location of the thermocouple no. 16). The results shown in Fig. 4b also indicate discrepancies in the coefficient relations identified as a function of time in the saturated boiling region, given at points corresponding to thermocouple no. 4, probably related to saturated boiling variations during the registration of flow oscillations (see Fig. 5), pressure fluctuations (see Fig. 6) and dynamic changes in the two-phase flow patterns. Since the local heat transfer coefficients corresponding to the

temperatures indicated by thermocouple no. 4 had different plots from the others (much higher values, with a few extremes), in Fig. 4c they were compiled local heat transfer coefficients corresponding to the indication of two neighboring thermocouples no. 3 and no. 5. All three plots of heat transfer coefficient vs. time in Fig. 4c appeared to be similar, which confirms the higher values of the coefficient and occurrence of its extremes for approximated times t = 100 s (minimum) and t = 112 s (maximum). The temperature relationships shown in Fig. 3c, which indicate a dryout, are supported by the distribution of local heat transfer coefficients, as for thermocouple no. 16 the coefficient values were lowest (see Fig. 4c). Generally, the results shown in Fig. 4 confirm the heat transfer coefficient dependencies previously observed when the authors analyzed results obtained from experiments and calculations conducted for the steady state.
The instability of mass flux and pressure are widely featured in many works on the flow with change of phase. Papers often reported instabilities under certain conditions in micro- or minichannels as e.g. [4,6,35­39]. Some scientists assume that phenomena during flow boiling have a wave-like nature, others represent the concepts of classification flow structures as repeated cyclically, the so-called oscillating flow structures of different types. According to [6] a stability criterion might be derived from the experimental results considering the two controlled parameters (heat flux and liquid inlet mass flow rate). In the experiment the liquid inlet mass flow rate is kept nearly constant and heat flux is gradually increased.
The values of the time-dependent experimental parameters for the tested series are presented for: mass flow rate - in Fig. 5, inlet

pressure - in Fig. 6 and outlet pressure - in Fig. 7. The values obtained for the subcooled boiling region are shown in Figs. 5a, 6a and 7a and for the saturated boiling region - in Figs. 5b, 6b and 7b, respectively. Observed instabilities are dynamic. Such instabilities are related to the change of the mass flow density (density-wave instability) and often occur with pressure-drop instabilities. Analysis of all instabilities recorded during the experiment indicates their oscillating character. The instabilities in mass flow rate recorded in the saturated boiling region (Fig. 5b) have also a wavy character.
Dynamic instabilities are often accompanied by thermal oscillations which occur in a convective boiling upflow system. The term ``thermal oscillations" has been used in situations where temperature fluctuations occur in a solid interacting with a fluid. The thermal oscillations are characterized by large amplitude fluctuations in the heated wall temperature. The flow oscillates between different types of two-phase flow and thus produces large amplitude temperature oscillations [40,41]. Fig. 8 shows an example of the thermal oscillations plot. The values of the time-dependent foil temperature recorded for thermocouple No. 8 were selected as representative values for each of boiling regions, i.e., for the subcooled boiling region data and for the saturated boiling region, as presented in Fig. 8a and c, respectively.
5. Estimation of the mean relative error for the calculation of the heat transfer coefficient
The mean relative error of the heat transfer coefficient was determined by the following formula:

Fig. 10 presents the values of the time-dependent mean relative

error for the tested series calculated by the presented method sep-

arately for the subcooled boiling region, Fig. 10a, and the saturated

boiling region, Fig. 10b. In the subcooled boiling region, the values

of errors were about 5% for all measurements. The relationship in

Fig. 10a indicates that mean relative differences in this boiling

region decrease nearly linearly during the experiment. The present

results confirm the errors obtained previously in the steady state measurements, whose values were also 2­6%.
In the saturated boiling region, the errors were noticeably higher, from about 20% at the final moment of the experiment (118­123 s) to even 58% at 108 s of the experiment. Fig. 10b shows a large scatter of the errors between 88 and 114 s. In the steady state experiments, the values of errors were also considerably higher in the saturated boiling region, in the order of 20% [42], than those obtained in the subcooled boiling region. These relatively high error values are likely associated with a small difference between the heated foil temperature and the saturation temperature (T(x, d, t) À Tsat(x, t)) in Eq. (1), along with substantial fluctuations and oscillations of the experimental parameters acquired in the saturated boiling region.
6. Conclusions
Flow boiling heat transfer with FC-72 Fluorinert was evaluated in a vertical minichannel with a thin foil as a heated element. The temperature of the foil was observed by 18 K-type thermocouples mounted at 18 points on its outer surface. Data acquisition stations monitored all experimental parameters measured at 0.01 s intervals. The heat transfer coefficient at the foil-fluid interface was calculated. The solution to a two-dimensional unsteady-state inverse boundary problem, solved in time-dependent subdomains using the Trefftz method, gave the foil temperature. Its approximate value satisfies the differential equation exactly. The boundary conditions are satisfied only approximately. Time-dependent Trefftz functions were found to be suitable for constructing approximate solution to the heat equation needed to identify the timedependent heat transfer coefficient.
The temperature field distributions on foil-fluid contact surface and the local heat transfer coefficient were analyzed separately for

two areas: the subcooled and the saturated boiling regions. It can be noticed that in the subcooled boiling region, an increase in the heat flux caused an increase in the temperature of the heated foil with no nucleation hysteresis. In the saturated boiling region a considerable foil temperature increase was observed at the minichannel outlet, caused probably by the dryout.
The values of the time-dependent heat transfer coefficient and at the boundary y = d, in the subcooled boiling, indicated a uniform monotonic increase over time, which confirms the results obtained by the authors in their previous studies of steady-state conditions. In the subcooled boiling region, the heat transfer coefficient was relatively low. The local values of the heat transfer coefficient increased slightly with the distance from the minichannel inlet. In the saturated boiling region the heat transfer coefficient was very high. The highest coefficients in the time interval analyzed corresponded to the beginning of saturated boiling in the minichannel. The lowest values of the coefficient were observed at the channel outlet. At the inlet, local heat transfer coefficients show a noticeable scatter during the experiment. A uniform decrease in the coefficient value over time was observed at consecutive points located along the minichannel.
Error propagation in time was investigated and low errors in the subcooled boiling region and high errors in the saturated boiling region were observed. The mean relative differences determined between the measured and computed heated foil temperatures did not exceed 10% in the entire experiment.
